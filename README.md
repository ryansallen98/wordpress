# Bedrock + Sage (Extended Starter)

**Opinionated WordPress starter stack combining Bedrock and Sage, with
Alpine.js, Blade Icons, and WooCommerce support out of the box.**

This is a public starter repository that bundles the Roots Bedrock
WordPress stack together with the Sage starter theme, preconfigured for
modern Laravel-style WordPress development.

Instead of wiring everything together manually for each project, this
repo gives you a ready-to-go foundation.

### Theme Stack (Sage)

## Why This Starter?

The goal of this starter is to eliminate repetitive setup when starting
new WordPress projects:

    compatibility
